spinach - A scalable Java Disque client
=============

Spinach is a scalable thread-safe Disque client providing both synchronous and
asynchronous APIs. Multiple threads may share one connection. Spinach is based on
[lettuce](https://github.com/mp911de/lettuce).
Multiple connections are efficiently managed by the excellent netty NIO
framework.

* Works with Java 6, 7 and 8
* synchronous and asynchronous connections
* [Codecs](https://github.com/mp911de/lettuce/wiki/Codecs) (for UTF8/bit/JSON etc. representation of your data)
