              spinach 0.1.1 RELEASE NOTES

This release fixes a reconnection bug. spinach allows to specify multiple connection
points. The first working connection point will allow a connection but if the connection
is down, only the connection point of the broken connection will be used for reconnecting.
So the reconnect sticks to the broken host/connection point without trying the other
specified connection points. The current release addresses this issue by using round-robin
and utilizes all provided connection points for a reconnect.

Features
------------
* Reconnect sticks to the last known connection point and does not use additional connection points #7

spinach requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and Java 6 run. It is tested continuously against Disque.
